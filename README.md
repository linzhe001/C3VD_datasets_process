# C3VD_datasets_process
## Introduction to Different Folders

### C3VD
Used to store the original dataset: depth maps, 3D models, pose files
```
├── C3VD
│   └── cecum_t1_a
│       ├── 0000_depth.tiff
│       ├── coverage_mesh.obj
│       └── pose.txt
```
### C3VD_ply
This folder is generated by ``creat_check_pcd.py``, containing ply files synthesized from single-frame depth maps. It already includes point clouds of the first ten frames for subsequent testing.
```
├── C3VD_ply
│   └── cecum_t1_a
│       └── 0000_depth.ply
```
### fused_C3VD_new
This file is generated by ``create_merge.py``, containing multi-frame synthesized point clouds and json files with point cloud information
```
├── fused_all_C3VD
│   └── cecum_t1_a
│       └── cecum_t1_a_merged_all.ply
```

## Workflow

1. First run ``creat_check_pcd.sh`` to generate point clouds using depth maps

2. Run ``create_merge_all.sh`` to generate multi-frame synthesized point clouds stored in the ``fused_all_C3VD`` folder

3. Run ``scaling.sh`` to scale ``fused_all_C3VD`` according to the size of the 3D model.

The above is my complete process for generating synthesized point clouds. From step 2 onwards, I have not tested on my local computer, only used on the cluster.

## Description of Files Not Mentioned Above

### ``Omni_pcd.py``
This Python file uses an omnidirectional camera approach to generate point clouds using depth maps, but the provided ``camera_intrinsics`` is just a sample and is not correct.
